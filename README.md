# Entropy
> **Restore the human chaos.**

**Entropy** is an advanced AI humanizer designed to break the sterile, predictable patterns of machine-generated text. By injecting controlled imperfections, stylistic nuances, and natural "chaos," Entropy transforms robotic content into writing that feels authentically human.

## Features

### 🌪️ The Chaos Engine
Adjust the randomness of your text with our proprietary **Chaos Slider**.
- **0-30%**: Clean, professional, but less robotic.
- **30-70%**: Natural, casual flow with varied sentence structures.
- **70-100%**: High entropy. Slang, fragments, and raw human imperfection.

### 🎭 Vibe Control
Tailor the personality of your text:
- **Casual**: Like a Reddit comment or Discord chat.
- **Start-up**: Punchy, direct, and slightly aggressive.
- **Academic**: Complex but readable, avoiding AI jargon.
- **Professional**: Experienced and authoritative.

### ⚡ Dual Processing Modes
- **Lite Mode**: Runs 100% locally in your browser. Scans for and removes common "AI kill phrases" (e.g., "delve," "tapestry," "landscape") instantly.
- **Pro Mode**: Connects to the Gemini API for deep stylistic rewriting, restructuring entire paragraphs for maximum undetectability.

### 🔒 Privacy First
**Entropy** is a client-side application. Your API keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage and are never sent to our servers.
